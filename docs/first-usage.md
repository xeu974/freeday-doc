# First usage

## Web client

When running Freeday for the first time, you need to go on the Welcome page so you can create the first administrator account.

Run `docker logs freeday-api` to display Freeday API logs and get the Welcome URL from there.

> Note: The Welcome URL will appear in the API logs only if there is no user in database

## Slack bot

Go into your Slack workspace and reach the *Applications* section at the bottom of the sidebar and hit *Add applications*.

Your Freeday app should appear in the app list. Click it and start chatting with the Freeday Slack bot.
